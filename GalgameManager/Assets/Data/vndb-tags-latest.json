Netorare is more than a simple act of infidelity, but the fetishization of jealousy and other negative feelings commonly associated with it.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The protagonist's significant other, a very close friend, or in some cases, a close relative is stolen from him by someone seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are literally stolen, but the negative feelings experienced by their significant other might make it seem so.\n\n2. The one who loses their loved one almost always finds out about the situation and suffers from jealousy and the feeling of helplessness arisen from an inability to change anything. The one stealing the lover and/or the stolen loved one might rub it in by humiliating the loser in private or in public.\n\n3. The trait does [b]not[/b] apply if the character having sex with someone else does not have a close loving relationship with the protagonist, and if the protagonist does not experience jealousy and other negative feelings upon finding out about the act. In other words, the ties between the partners and their forcible separation is important to the netorare fetish. For example, an unrequited crush or a potential hero(ine) on a different route would not count for the purposes of this fetish.\n\n4. The act of stealing must happen while the protagonist is in a relationship with the stolen significant other. Scenes of heroine's past relationships do not count as Netorare.\n\nThe game is usually portrayed from the perspective of someone losing his significant other, in order to delve deep into the jealousy aspect of the fetish, however, for story purposes the game might switch between multiple POVs and also portray the events from the perspective of the stolen SO.","id":513,"meta":false,"name":"Netorare","parents":[1673,2919],"searchable":true,"vns":1266},{"aliases":[],"applicable":true,"cat":"ero","description":"Netori is a counterpart tag to [url=/g513]Netorare[/url], however instead of playing as someone who has his significant lover stolen, you play as the one doing the stealing.\n\nRather than fetishizing jealousy and other negative feelings, Netori is a power trip of pulling one over another person and taking something that is theirs.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netori, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The protagonist steals the significant other, a very close friend, or in extremely rare cases, a close relative from another character by seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques.\n\n2. The character stolen must be someone you are not supposed to steal. As an example, the protagonist having sex with someone's mother wouldn't be Netori, if she doesn't have a significant other. However, it would become Netori if she is the protagonist's own mother, and the father is present in the game in some form.\n\n3. For Netori-themed games the finding out aspect is less important, as the game focuses on the protagonist and his conquest.

They are most often found in games on mobile platforms, but are not exclusive to them.\n\nRather than paying for content directly, games with microtransactions often require the player to buy amounts of a \"premium\" currency, which is then exchanged for the content that they want.\n\nIn visual novels, microtransactions can be implemented in any or all of the following ways (this list is not exhaustive):\n\n1. The player can only read a certain amount of the VN in a single day, but can pay to read more. This is often represented by a \"tickets\" system in VNs, or a \"stamina\" or \"energy\" gauge in other types of games.\n\n2. When the player comes to a choice point, the \"best\" choice requires the player to pay to select it. This may simply unlock a CG or may be required for a good ending.\n\n3.

The usual changes experienced by the character are these:\n\n1. Looks: Character starts dressing in revealing and eye-catching clothing, wear gaudy make-up and lots of fashion accessories, dye their hair (blonde colour dominates, but other variations are possible). Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.\n\n2. Outlook: The character starts craving hedonistic activities and frequently participates in parties and other social gatherings. They usually become sexually [url=/g1667]promiscuous[/url] and start having sex with multiple partners. They might even get involved in sex work.\n\n3. Intelligence: In fantasy/sci-fi settings the character usually is subjected to mental degradation that somehow decreases their intelligence.

Drug use and abuse is also pretty common in such works.\n\nA particular variation of the trope present in Japan is Gyarufication (and by extension Gangurofication), where a normal high school girl (or a young woman) usually falls in with a bad crowd, and over the course of the game starts displaying looks and attitude associated with the negative [url=/i1219]Gyaru[/url] / [url=/i1054]Ganguro[/url] stereotypes.
